WARNING: The Torch is so bright that shining directly in a person or animal's eyes for more than 3 seconds is likely to result in a serious eye injury. (So it's GREAT for personal defense like mace without the mess!)

Here's what these water proof, aircraft aluminum flashlights look like. (WOW). *

P.S. 
I just checked for you and there are only 117 Torch flashlights in stock...and going FAST!

When they are gone, they're gone. (So hurry!)
